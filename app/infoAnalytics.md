The analytics section is designed to facilitate data exploration and additional insight generation pertaining to Glen Art Theater management's interests and needs. Unlike the dashboard, the visuals presented on this page are all interactive, allowing the user the ability to slice and dice the data as desired through input filters, hover over data points for additional information, and zoom in and out for better clarity. These visuals are spread across three primary tabs at the top of the page: Predictive, Historical, and Raw Data. A brief description of the different tabs follows.

#### Predictive

This tab allows the user to explore information that is predictive in nature. The first input filter is to choose one of two prediction methods: predicted gross revenue or film lifecycle earnings. The second filter is to select a time period for which to forecast. If the user selects Date Range, a new filter will appear prompting the user to select a start and end date. The final filter is to make selections from a drop down of available films. The performance of these films during the chosen time period will be predicted and the results shown in the box to the right.

The two prediction method plots are nearly identical, with the key difference being that the predicted gross revenue plot will show the predicted performance of all of the films combined while the film lifecycle earnings plot will stratify that result by film. This type of analysis can provide management with insight into potential lulls or peaks in performance or which films will be worth going after contracts to show.

#### Historical

This tab allows the user to revisit past performance for either the last week, month or quarter. The box office predictions are shown along with the actual results to evaluate how the models are performing. This information paired with the predictive analysis are extremely valuable for theater management decision making.

#### Raw Data

For the interested user, this tab displays the data used to generate all of the visuals contained in this application. The FilMetrics data were obtained from a number of open sources including imdb.com, themoviedb.org, and movielens.org. Weekly, monthly and quarter data were obtained from the-numbers.com. Links to all of these external websites can be found in the box under the data tables.
